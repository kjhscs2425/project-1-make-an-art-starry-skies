# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

My drawing will be a flower with a face. There will be 12 identical petals and a circular face in the middle.


2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

    Variable 1: I can create a variable for the radius of the circle so that every time I inputted a new number, the radius of the circle would change and the circle would get bigger/smaller. 
    Variable 2 : I can create a variable for height of each petal so that the petals get smaller and bigger depending on what number I input.
3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
    Each petal will be identical. Also, the eyes of the flower will be indentical.
4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
    There are two main parts: a circle (the face) and an oval-like shape that is duplicated 12 times.
5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? 
 Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
I can create a loop variable when creating the flower petals because, although the size of each petal is identical, each petal will have a slightly different location.
